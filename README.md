#### Firechat
Xamarin.iOS app. Most complicated app I have created. Uses GPS data to calculate change in location, stores changes, and trace user positions onto apples integrated map. Running in parallel is audio data. The app uses audio data to try to calculate a gun shot in real time. The apps target market is for hunters. The app is not yet published, with some complications in audio manipulation.
